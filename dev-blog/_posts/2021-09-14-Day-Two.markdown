Today is day two. Spent the day working on Tasks on https://javascript.info/array-methods.
The Create an Extensible Calculator task was hard, although I think I get the constructor functions now,
they are basically the way JavaScript implements classes from other languages, which makes much more sense
now rather than trying to think of them as a function. Slow going but progress was made, hopefully can speed
things up and get through this JS tutorial quickly and actually build some things.
