This is day one. I will keep a diary here of what I do each day towards my goal of becoming a developer.

Today I kind of figured out how to set up a blog using Jekyll and hosted on Github.
Still very new to Github, and not quite sure exatly how Jekyll and Ruby? are working together.
However, it seems to work. The tutorial is really not clear, and actually misses a few steps which does not help.
