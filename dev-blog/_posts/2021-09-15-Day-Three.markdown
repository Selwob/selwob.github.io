Day Three and I kind of finished off the array structures. Trying to work out how to create the arrow function equivalents of methods with callback functions of old style loops is not coming naturally, but thanks to some 
YouTube videos

I think I'm seeing how they work and how to create them myself now. Just need to practice.

Read through:
  <a href = "https://javascript.info/iterable">Iterable</a>
  <a href = "https://javascript.info/map-set">Map-set</a>
  <a href = "https://javascript.info/weakmap-weakset">Weakmap-weakset</a>
  
I think this is too much just reading and doing exercises. Must try to build something simple soon.
